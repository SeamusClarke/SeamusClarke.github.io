							<h1>My research</h1>
							<p class="major">  My research focuses on using hydrodynamic simulations to study how the diffuse gas of the Interstellar medium (ISM) is able to condense into filaments and cores, leading to the formation of stars. I'm especially interested in the interplay between gravity and turbulence in dense gas filaments and the role this has on fragmentation. I am also interested in the chemical evolution of the ISM as gas moves from the diffuse gas into dense cores, and how this influences how these structures are seen when observed with dust and molecular line tracers.</p>

							<h2>Filament dynamics</h2>
							<p>  

Filaments are intimately linked to the star formation process; however, their internal dynamics and the mechanism by which they fragment to form stars is not well understood. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations I study the roles that gravity, turbulence and magnetic fields have on the filament evolution. I use the SPH and meshless code <a href = "http://gandalfcode.github.io/"> GANDALF </a> and the moving-mesh code <a href = "https://www.h-its.org/tap-software-en/arepo/"> AREPO </a>

							<h2> Filament fragmentation </h2>
							<p> 

Filament fragmentation is an important process which governs how gas collects into dense cores. Previous models have made the assumption that the filament is in hydrostatic equilibrium; I have developed non-equilibrium models which show that the gas accretion onto a filament plays an important role in fragmentation. Moreover, degree of turbulence within the accretion material greatly affects the fragmentation of the filament. Filaments which are gravity dominated fragment in a two-tier manner similar to the observed fragmentation of the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. When turbulence dominates in the accretion material, the filament first fragments into sub-filaments and then into cores which produce stars. </p>

							<h2> Filament collapse</h2>
							<p> 

Due to their geometry, the gravitational collapse of a filament differs significantly from that of a spherical cloud. The two longitudinal ends of the filament are rapidly accelerated towards the filament's centre and act as snowploughs, accreting gas as they travel. The collapse is also much longer than that of an equally dense sphere; I have developed an equation for the timescale of the collapse, analogous to the spherical free-fall time. This makes filaments an excellent site for star formation as the structure is more long-lived than a spherical clump and the massive and dense snowplough end regions can rapidly fragment. The Musca filament exhibits the signs of filamentary collapse.

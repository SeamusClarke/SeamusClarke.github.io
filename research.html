										<h3>Overview</h3>
									</header>
									<p> 
									My PhD and postdoctoral career has been focused on the role of filaments in the star formation process. This problem has risen to prominence as the Herschel Space Observatory showed that filamentary structures are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, and importantly that most new stars are born within these filaments. It is currently unclear just what this means for star formation however as filament geometry changes how gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and feedback act and interact with each other. My work tries to answer this question using numerical simulations, synthetic observations and real observations. 
									</p>

									<p> I am also highly interested in statistical techniques as well as testing and developing new analysis tools. Due to the large volume of data that is currently involved astrophysics, standardised, efficient, tested and often automated analysis tools are essential. So far I have developed tools to <a href="https://github.com/SeamusClarke/BTS"><b>fit molecular line spectra</b></a>, <a href="https://github.com/SeamusClarke/RJplots"><b>classify structure morphology</b></a> and <a href="https://github.com/SeamusClarke/FragMent"><b>detect fragmentation length-scales</b></a>.</p>

									<h3>Numerical simulations</h3>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/2020.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4390C/abstract"><b>In my 2020 paper</b></a> I investigated the hierarchical fragmentation of accreting, turbulent filaments. In my earlier work I discovered that internal turbulence leads to the formation of smaller sub-filaments within filaments, but what this means for the formation of cores was unclear. Here I found that cores form in two environments: (i) as isolated cores, or small chains of cores, on a single sub-filament, or (ii) as an ensemble of cores located at the junction of sub-filaments. I termed these <i>isolated</i> and <i>hub</i> cores, respectively. I showed that these core populations are statistically different from each other. Hub cores have a greater mean mass than isolated cores, and the mass distribution of hub cores is significantly wider than isolated cores. Interestingly, this fragmentation is reminiscent of parsec-scale hub-filament systems, showing that the combination of turbulence and gravity leads to similar fragmentation signatures on multiple scales, even within filaments.</p>

									<p> I also applied my FragMent module to study the fragmentation pattern of the filament into cores. I found that the fact that fragmentation proceeds through sub-filaments suggests that there exists no characteristic fragmentation length-scale between cores. This is in opposition to earlier theoretical works studying fibre-less filaments which suggest a strong tendency towards the formation of quasi-periodically spaced cores, but in better agreement with observations. </p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/2017.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.2489C/abstract"><b>In my 2017 paper</b></a> I presented simulations building upon my earlier work and investigated the effects of turbulence on the fragmentation of filaments. I showed that filaments that experience a weakly turbulent accretion flow fragment in a two-tier hierarchical fashion, similar to the fragmentation pattern seen in the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. Increasing the energy in the turbulent velocity field results in more sub-structure within the filaments, and one sees a shift from gravity-dominated fragmentation to turbulence-dominated fragmentation. The sub-structure formed in the filaments is elongated and roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the filament, i,e, sub-filaments. I showed that the formation of these sub-filaments structures is linked to the vorticity of the velocity field inside the filament, driven by the accretion. I also noted that the supercritical filaments that contain sub-filaments do not collapse radially, a possible solution to the problem of wide supercritical filaments. </p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/2016.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="hhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.458..319C/abstract"><b>In my 2016 paper</b></a> I investigated the growth of perturbations in infinitely long filaments as they form and grow by accretion. The growth of these perturbations lead to filament fragmentation and the formation of cores. Most previous work on this subject was confined to the growth and fragmentation of equilibrium filaments and found that there exists a characteristic fragmentation scale which is roughly four times the filament's diameter. My results showed a more complicated dispersion relation with a series of peaks linking perturbation wavelength and growth rate. These are due to gravo-acoustic oscillations along the longitudinal axis during the sub-critical phase of growth. The positions of the peaks in growth rate have a strong dependence on both the mass accretion rate onto the filament and the temperature of the gas. When seeded with a multiwavelength density power spectrum, I showed that there exists a clear preferred core separation equal to the largest peak in the dispersion relation. </p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/2015.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.449.1819C/abstract"><b>In my 2015 paper</b></a> I investigated the longitudinal collapse time-scales of filaments; these time-scales are important because they determine the time available for a filament to fragment into cores. Pon et al. (2012) considered the global dynamics of filaments analytically and concluded that short filaments (with aspect ratios less than 5) collapse along the z-axis more-or-less homologously; in contrast, longer filaments (with aspect ratios greater than 5) undergo end-dominated collapse, i.e. two dense clumps form at the ends of the filament and converge on the centre sweeping up mass as they go. My simulations did not corroborate these predictions. First, the collapse is always end-dominated. Secondly, the collapse time satisfies a single equation of linear form which for large aspect ratios is much longer than the Pon et al. prediction. Thirdly, before being swept up, the gas immediately ahead of an end-clump is actually accelerated outwards by the gravitational attraction of the approaching clump, resulting in a significant ram pressure. For high aspect ratio filaments, the end-clumps approach an asymptotic inward speed, due to the fact that they are doing work both accelerating and compressing the gas they sweep up.This outward acceleration and its consequences was neglected by previous works. </p>

									<h3>Synthetic observations</h3>

									<p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/2018.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479.1722C/abstract"><b>In my 2018 paper</b></a> I presented synthetic observations of simulations similar to my 2017 models. Recent observations had shown that filaments contain inside them velocity coherent structures termed fibres. In this work I showed that fibres traced in position-position-velocity space are not guaranteed to be real coherent structures in position-position-position space. Rather, these fibres are kinematic artefacts of the accretion-driven turbulence which forms the real sub-filament structures seen in position-position-position space. Thus I showed that one should treat with caution interpretations of fibres as building-blocks of star formation. It is also in this paper that I presented my BTS code for fully-automated spectral fitting. </p>

									<h3>Analysis tools</h3>

									<p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/2022.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220807509C/abstract"><b>In my 2022 paper</b></a> I presented the structure classification module RJ-plots. The large data sets resulting from observational surveys and state-of-the-art simulations studying hierarchical structures means that identification and classification must be done in an automated fashion to be efficient. RJ-plots allows clear distinctions between quasi-circular/elongated structures and centrally over/under-dense structures. I used the recent morphological SEDIGISM catalogue of Neralwar et al. (2022) to show the improvement in classification resulting from RJ-plots, especially for ring-like and concentrated cloud types. I also found a strong correlation between the central concentration of a structure and its star formation efficiency and dense gas fraction, as well as a lack of correlation with elongation. Furthermore, I used the accreting filament simulations from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4390C/abstract"><b>my 2020 paper</b></a> to highlight a multi-scale application of RJ-plots, finding that while spherical structures become more common at smaller scales they are never the dominant structure down to  r∼0.03  pc.</p>

Many models of filament fragmentation suggest that fragmentation characteristic scales should occur but no one knew which techniques were best at detecting them and how many cores would be necessary. I compiled a number of fragmentation analysis techniques and applied them to filaments, testing their sensitivity to characteristic scales. I also developed null hypothesis tests which should be used when judging the statistical significance of any suspected characteristic scales. From these I presented the best practice for investigating filament fragmentation: that a combination of the nearest neighbour separation, minimum spanning tree and two point correlation techniques should be used to detect characteristic scales; then a null hypothesis should be used to test the significance of the detection; and if the null is rejected one may decide if the observed fragmentation is best described by single-tier or two-tier fragmentation, using either Akaike's information criterion or the Bayes factor. </p>

									<h3>Observations</h3>

									<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/SNR.png" alt="" width="400" ></span>  Observations is a field I have begun to explore. Due to my work on synthetic observations I begun to become familiar with a number of techniques used to analysis real observational data. I have started two new projects using observations; one is a study of the interaction of a supernova remnant with a dense filamentary giant molecular cloud, and the other is a kinematic and fragmentation study of an outer-galaxy giant molecular filament. For both studies I use archival data from across the spectrum, from the radio to the X-ray, and am PI of a number of observing projects using telescopes such as the IRAM 30m, GBT, APEX, VLA and SOFIA. This is a field in which I hope to expand much more and publish a number of works.</p>
